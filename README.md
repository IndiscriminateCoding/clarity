## Clarity - functional programming library for OCaml
### Description

The goal of this project is to make pure functional programming idioms as useful as possible given OCaml's absense of higher-kinded types and typeclasses.

### Main features are:
* Standard "classes" like Functor-Applicative-Monad
* Concrete instances like Reader-Writer-State
* Useful data types like Either or These

### Installation:
    $ make install
