## Clarity - functional programming library for OCaml
### Description

The goal of this project is to make pure functional programming idioms as useful as possible given OCaml's absence of higher-kinded types and typeclasses.

### Main features are:

* Standard "classes" like Functor-Applicative-Monad
* Concrete instances like Reader-Writer-State
* Useful data types like Either, These or Vector

### Design notes

* All concrete datatypes also have it's constructors defined as values where name is prefixed with underscore. Sometimes it's more convenient to use "curried", first-class version of a constructor, e.g. following two are equivalent:
```ocaml
let long  = List.map (fun x -> Some x) a
let short = List.map _Some x
```
* Applicative operator `ap` and it's infix version `<~>` are "lazy" by it's second argument. This allows for an applicative to "fail-fast" and don't compute unneeded values. "Strict" versions are called `ap'` and `<\*>` respectively. "Laziness" here is just (unit -> 'a) closure, so you can use function combinators from Fn module for convenience:
```ocaml
open Clarity
open Option

(*
val (<*>) : ('a -> 'b) option -> 'a option -> 'b option
val (<~>) : ('a -> 'b) option -> (unit -> 'a option) -> 'b option

val serialize : int -> int -> string -> string
val idx : int option
val long_computation : int -> int option
val title : string option
*)

open Fn

let res : string Option.t =
  map serialize idx
    <~> defer long_computation 1024
    <*> title
```
* Right folds are also "lazy" by "accumulator" argument of a folding function. Strict right fold is called `foldr'`. This allows for shortcut when function no more needs data. For example, here is `any` function from Foldable module that checks if at least one element of a Foldable satisfies given predicate:
```ocaml
let any p = foldr (fun x a -> p x || a ()) false
```
